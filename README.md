# Virtual Gesture-Based Drawing System (Java + OpenCV)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a computer vision based drawing application that allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures captured through a webcam.  
The system tracks finger movement in real time and converts the motion into drawing strokes on the screen.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how computer vision and image processing techniques can be used to create natural human–computer interaction without using a mouse or touch input.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection using webcam
- Fingertip tracking for drawing on screen
- Virtual canvas to draw shapes and lines
- Color detection using HSV color space
- Gesture-controlled drawing without mouse or keyboard
- Smooth continuous drawing based on hand movement

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java
- OpenCV (Computer Vision Library)
- Image Processing Techniques
- HSV Color Detection
- Webcam Capture

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. The webcam captures live video frames.
2. Frames are processed using OpenCV.
3. The system detects hand/fingertip using color detection.
4. The fingertip coordinates are tracked frame-by-frame.
5. The tracked points are plotted onto a virtual canvas.
6. Continuous tracking creates a drawing effect.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Install Java (JDK 8 or above)
2. Download OpenCV and add the OpenCV `.jar` file to project libraries
3. Place OpenCV `.dll` file in the system path
4. Clone the repository:

5. Open the project in Eclipse or IntelliJ
6. Run the main Java file
